            <h2>我的动漫爱好</h2>
            <p>
                I began watching anime since middle school, and the first one I watched was "CODE GEASS Lelouch of the Rebellion". It's said that everyone who watches anime can draw, and I too post some of my drawings on my QQ space. I draw both characters from anime I like and my own original characters. When real life gets a bit exhausting, drawing and watching anime are great ways to relieve my stress and fatigue.
