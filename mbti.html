            <strong>INFJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)</strong><br>
            INFJs are often referred to as the "Advocate" or the "Idealist". They are rare, making up about 1% of the population, but they leave their mark on the world. INFJs possess a deep sense of idealism and integrity. They take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact. These individuals are gentle, caring, and complex, often sensing the emotions of those around them. They are keenly in tune with how others feel and genuinely want to help them. INFJs' strong intuition and feeling orientation can lead them to be incredibly compassionate and understanding, often allowing them to see through superficialities and understand an issue at its heart.
