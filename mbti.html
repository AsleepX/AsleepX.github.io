            <strong>I (Introverted)</strong><br>
            I'm somewhat introverted. To put it in a vivid way, the capacity of my social battery is small. When I converse with others, the charge in my social battery starts to drain. The more people I interact with, the faster it depletes. When my social battery is completely drained, I need to be alone to recharge.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>N (Intuitive)</strong><br>
            I enjoy daydreaming in the realm of the mind. Compared to hands-on tasks, I prefer theoretical learning. I often have impractical ideas in my head, so some people call me naive. I respond to them, only naive people can write interesting poetry.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>F (Feeling)</strong><br>
            When I have to make a decision about something, I tend to base it on feelings and values rather than on logic and reason.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>J (Judging)</strong><br>
            INFJs are often referred to as the "Advocate" or the "Idealist". They are rare, making up about 1% of the population, but they leave their mark on the world. INFJs possess a deep sense of idealism and integrity. They take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact. These individuals are gentle, caring, and complex, often sensing the emotions of those around them. They are keenly in tune with how others feel and genuinely want to help them. INFJs' strong intuition and feeling orientation can lead them to be incredibly compassionate and understanding, often allowing them to see through superficialities and understand an issue at its heart.
